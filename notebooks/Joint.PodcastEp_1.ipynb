or talk about books i cant remember but it was a long time ago and we are far overdue for a new episode so before we jump into anything just want to plug my social media you guys can follow me at south mosca on pretty much every social media besides snapchat is sopherrri also have more exclusive content on passes its just passcoms mosca i believe but i think if you go to passes you could probably just search my name and find it there but its also linkedin my hooby link which is in my bios but i also just wanted to thank you guys for following along on vlogmas if you did and i think you guys really enjoyed this years vlogmas i will say this wasnt my favorite vlogmas ever i definitely had like a lot going on behind the scenes one of which like the elephant in the room i moved and i was dealing with you know figuring out how to work out the like termination of a lease which ive never had to do before and it was just like overwhelming on top of you know literally living with the place with all the issues that you know were the reason i left and then also like finding a new place in the finances of that because moving no matter how you do it is so expensive and just you know all that on top of the holidays and i had all these pre planned holiday travels that were happening during you know all that like i dont know it was just not my favorite vlogmas ever but i also think it was hard because i was like comparing it to last year and last year was just like an exceptionally fun vlogmas i was just in a stage of life where every single day i was just hanging out with friends doing all these fun things and just made for like really fun vlogs and im just in a different stage of life or at least like you know in that moment in december like i just was in a different stage of life where i had a lot going on versus like last december i was at more of like a null and more of like a standstill and just was able to like enjoy life enjoy my time but im happy that you guys enjoyed the vlogs regardless and yeah that was log miss also thank you for your patience during vlogmas because there werent any podcast episodes so overall just thank you guys and so like i said i moved i now live in a house its still rented but i did move to a house if you guys havent been following along on i guess i really only talked about it on my blogs but my apartment just it had like every health worry issue that there could be theyre not even help like there was mold there was roaches but then also like my hot water would go out for like hours to days on end constantly theres so much more my garage door would be like jammed open like the garage for the whole building would be like jammed open so it wouldnt be closing which like obviously like i lived in a really busy area where like car theft would have been like very very possible and like you know when youre when you move into a place and youre paying for things you think youre getting and you dont end up getting them thats when it becomes an issue so like the the door was never closing or not never but the door often got jammed in the garage and like there was like front door security issues like sometimes my key literally wouldnt open the front door and then sometimes i wouldnt need a key to open the front door which obviously is a a security issue in and of itself the elevators a whole other story literally just so much and then there was like just the dryer didnt work and on top of these issues the management like wasnt solving them so obviously before i got to the point of like im i need to terminate this lease i had reached out again and again and again trying to resolve the issues cause i didnt want to have to move you know like i moving like i said it cost so much i just moved like 6 months ago and it was a big move it was from florida to la like i didnt want to move again so obviously like i had tried and tried and tried to get these things fixed and there would be times when like towards the end of it i would have sent like 5 emails because five different things came up and no answer but then i dont think i told this online but like so like this was my breaking point i had sent it was like everything was going wrong i didnt have hot water i found a couple more roaches i like the mold was an issue that kept coming to like quoteunquote fix my washer but all they would do is like clean it with vinegar and like it wasnt actually solving the mold issue like the mold isnt only like what you can see you know like mold spreads and its like probably in the wall and its like its just like nothing was actually being solved and i had like 6 technicians come and basically just like tell me my dryer is broken and im like i know i know but no one was fixing it no one was replacing it like it was just like absurd and ive been sending emails about like all the things that were going wrong its not getting a reply and then i had my automatic rent payments turned on but i forgot that i had turned them off i think i forget why i did it i think i was like switching a card or something i dont remember but i had automatic payments accidentally turned off and so the day after rent was due like obviously i thought that it was automatically paid but the day after it was due i got an email saying like not an automatic email like literally an email from the guy had i had been trying to get in contact with telling me that my rent was late and that i needed to pay it like immediately and that was my breaking point because i was like well now i know like you are blatantly ignoring my emails about real concerns like health concerns safety concerns but youll still take my money and like that was just my breaking point but anyways i ended up moving and i now live in a house wait also guys side note because i just took a sip of it im drinking this chamberlain coffee canned coffee ive heard so many people hate on it its literally so good\n","  Corrected:

actually solving the mold issue like the mold isnt only like what you can see you know like mold spreads and its like probably in the wall and its like its just like nothing was actually being solved and i had like 6 technicians come and basically just like tell me my dryer is broken and im like i know i know but no one was fixing it no one was replacing it like it was just like absurd and ive been sending emails about like all the things that were going wrong its not getting a reply and then i had my automatic rent payments turned on but i forgot that i had turned them off i think i forget why i did it i think i was like switching a card or something i dont remember but i had automatic payments accidentally turned off and so the day after rent was due like obviously i thought that it was automatically paid but the day after it was due i got an email saying like not an automatic email like literally an email from the guy had i had been trying to get in contact with telling me that my rent was late and that i needed to pay it like immediately and that was my breaking point because i was like well now i know like you are blatantly ignoring my emails about real concerns like health concerns safety concerns but youll still take my money and like that was just my breaking point but anyways i ended up moving and i now live in a house wait also guys side note because i just took a sip of it im drinking this chamberlain coffee canned coffee ive heard so many people hate on it its literally so good\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(\"Column Names:\",
