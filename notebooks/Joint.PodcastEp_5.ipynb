of groceries of all kinds and i just grabbed this on my way out because it was in the fridge it was that or a sugarfree red bull  and its 5 pm and i opted for the unknown of the kombucha over the known insanity of the sugarfree red bull and its fine its just the knowing like i told you before it and knowing that it supports digestive and immune health somehow makes it taste better its good for your gut ive been a kombucha fan like im sure people were drinking the boots like back in the 70s you signed up for that secret beach club you signed up for that secret beach club secret boadicea know  so what i would use to drink it in new york and like now i cant find them on the shelves anymore but there was a while there where like kombucha yeah would still be like 5 percent alcohol yeah because cuz the fermentation and they were like oh shit we gotta like start marking this because like kids are doing it yeah i remember when i was working an office job in new york and it was so boring like so boring if you guys how board was it both only worked office jobs for the smallest period of time no but it was when i worked at the recording studio and like i was working the front desk and they were like hey will you go work in accounting and i was like im not an accountant and they were like no well just show you how like see who owes us money and then send them an invoice like i knew exactly how to do the four things they told me to do and even still i was never confident yeah like at any point when the boss walked in i was like this is where they tell me i fucked up
