sentences:\n","Sentence 1:\n","  ASR: what if i told you that breaking bad habits was actually a lot easier than you might think well thats what im saying so one of the interesting things about habit building is that we are constantly doing it we are building habits whether we are trying to or not and often times those habits arent necessarily the best so we might be building a habit around what time we wake up each morning and that time might be later than we want it to be or for many of us were building a habit around hitting snooze in the mornings or were building a habit around the specific foods that eat at specific times of the day for example if you are regularly crashing around 200 300 pm youve got that postlunch slump and you reach for candy or coffee or whatever it is thats becoming a habit we are building habits constantly and we dont typically really know it we dont recognize it as its happening and this is extremely true when it comes to building bad habits or negative habits undesirable habits its things that we ourselves dont necessarily want to maintain or keep doing we are regularly building now theres a few things we need to think about when it comes to building  undesirable habits and that is that often times they are harder to break than good habits its much much harder to get ourselves to not do something bad for us than it is to get ourselves to do something good for us and a big reason why this happens is simply is when we do a  habit typically the reward for that is instantaneous so think about the candy bar its 2 pm you are exhausted youre falling asleep you reach for a snickers or whatever your brand of candy is my case it would be some kind of gummies so you reach for your sour trollee gummy worms and what ends up happening is you take a bite youve got the sugar instantly you feel awake your alert you feel better better immediately it happens right then right there and so what you end up finding is that that reward happened so instantaneously you are given the dopamine in the anticipation and in the followthrough almost instantly and so you start to crave it however there are punishments when it comes to negative habits the problem is those punishments come later so you might crash in two to three hours because you had that bag of andy but its harder to associate that crash with the candy simply because its delayed and the same is true when it comes to our positive habits as well except its in reverse so typically when we are doing something good for us we dont get the benefit of that until later we get ourselves to the gym or we wake up at a certain time or we dont hit snooze or whatever it is we tend to not get the reward from that on till the next day a few hours later a few weeks later a few months later and so its harder to associate those positive rewards with the actual behavior however we often get some of the downsides instantaneously so for example if you do a workout and you are exhausted afterwards and your muscles hurt in your sore whatever your feelings are maybe theyre not necessarily  but theyre certainly not that if either for many of us and so because we tend to have that sort of inverse relationship between the two where negative habits that were building have an immediate positive reward and positive habits that were trying to build have an immediate somewhat negative reward it becomes significantly easier to lean into those negative behaviors we choose to snooze rather than wake up because snoozing gives us that instantaneous reward lord and waking up is going to feel bad because were tired and we want to keep sleeping even though wait just a little bit longer and waking up all of a sudden becomes the right decision because after an hour after two hours when you start to be on top of things because you woke up earlier thats going to feel good rather than being behind because you decided to snooze so weve got this inverse relationship and one of the things that i think we take for granted in this says is that breaking bad habits is harder now that we understand a little bit about why theyre so easy to build and why theyre so easy to latch onto while positive habits are so much more difficult its important to also understand that breaking them is also difficult building them is easier and breaking them is harder because it means sacrificing that instantaneous reward so with all of that said how do we then approach this how do we break those bad habits in a way that feels easier well theres a theory and i first learned this from dr andrew huberman on the huberman labs podcast and i dont quite remember honestly what he called it so im just going to call it habit replacement there is this idea that if you take a negative habit and you instantly follow it up with a positive habit you to link the two behaviors and so for example lets play this through lets say that you are snoozing in the morning thats your  habit that youre trying to break and you then change that or rather when you hit snooze you use that as the new trigger to lets say meditate or two to take deep breaths or whatever it might be for you when you start to do that you link those two behaviors and so the new behavior the positive behavior youre trying to build the meditation the deep breathing whatever it is that starts to be linked with the trigger for that old behavior so that  habit of waking up alarm goes off im going to hit snooze alarm goes off is now linked with im going to meditate im going to journal and what you can do when this happens is start to slowly replace the negative behavior now its not going to be sent aeneas youre going to fall back on that negative behavior over time and its going to take a little bit of willpower but it does make breaking those bad habits significantly easier to go through it in this way so how do we use this in practice well theres two ways to look at it we can use it for them the perspective of i want to break a bad habit or we can use it from the perspective of i want to build a good habit since we know that negative habits are significantly easier to build then we can start to use that power that strength of of the habit reinforcement and apply it through this replacement process towards building a positive habit\n","  Corrected: what if i told you that breaking bad

negative habit of waking up alarm goes off im going to hit snooze alarm goes off is now linked with im going to meditate im going to journal and what you can do when this happens is start to slowly replace the negative behavior now its not going to be instantenous youre going to fall back on that negative behavior over time and its going to take a little bit of willpower but it does make breaking those bad habits significantly easier to go through it in this way so how do we use this in practice well theres two ways to look at it we can use it for them the perspective of i want to break a bad habit or we can use it from the perspective of i want to build a good habit since we know that negative habits are significantly easier to build then we can start to use that power that strength of of the habit reinforcement and apply it through this replacement process towards building a positive habit\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(\"Column Names:\",
