"This make it weird. Are we rolling? Rolling. Cheers, Grace. Healthiest memory. Are you guys? We are back and Grace is drinking a kombucha and I could not be prouder. Yeah, thank you. Its taste like sparkling vinegar. Well, yeah, I was gonna say. I've never seen you drink a kombucha and I didn't know when I watched you crack it open. If you knew the vibe. What I was applying to. This came from my recent hungry route, delivery more on that during the commercial break of this episode of the podcast. Wow, we got a plug-in and the first 30 seconds of this bitch. Know, they send a bunch of groceries of all kinds. And I just grabbed this on my way out, because it was in the fridge. It was that, or a sugar-free Red Bull  And it's 5 p.m., and I opted for the unknown of the kombucha, over the known insanity of the sugar-free Red Bull. And it's fine. It's just the knowing like I told you before it. And knowing that it supports digestive and immune health somehow, makes it taste better. It's good for your gut. I've been a kombucha fan, like I'm sure people were drinking the boots like back in the 70s you signed up for that secret Beach Club. You signed up for that secret Beach Club. Secret Boadicea know.  So what I would use to drink it in New York and like now I can't find them on the shelves anymore. But there was a while there where like kombucha yeah would still be like .5 percent alcohol. Yeah. Because Cuz the fermentation and they were like, oh shit, we gotta like start marking this because like kids are doing it. Yeah, I remember when I was working an office job in New York and it was so boring, like, so boring. If you guys how board was it? Both only worked office jobs for the smallest period of time. No, but it was when I worked at the recording studio and like, I was working the front desk and they were like, hey, will you go work in accounting? And I was like, I'm not an accountant and they were like, no, we'll just show you how like see who owes us money and then send them an invoice. Like I knew exactly how to do the four things they told me to do and even still I was never confident. Yeah. Like, at any point when the boss walked in, I was like this is where they tell me I fucked up and cost the company five million dollars. And this is how we feel. Every time I send our footage to Nick who edits a podcast. Every week I'm waiting, patiently for him to email back and be like, there's no sound. Yeah. So you were going under because of you, but it was so boring that this was, I was like, so excited. I had access to a scanner. Oh, hell yeah. And I used to like this is how little we knew about computers back in the day, like. I would like write notes on like a post-It note, scan it, and then it would go on the computer. And then, I would like post that on my blog. Oh, huge queue. That was so advanced. I was making their, you got into the career path you did. But anyway. I would drink one of those kombuchas, on the way to work and be like, you are not buzzed off point, five percent alcohol, but it like gave me just enough to placebo effect, the edge. But then, what's so funny is I also had a roommate situation. I lived with my friend, Aaron for a minute, in New York City and she was making her own kombucha. Oh, my God. Is that gross looking? It's what is it called?""The mother that, yeah, I learned about that also, living in Brooklyn."" I feel like it's a Rite of Passage to live in Brooklyn and to have some to see Gia somewhere being made, in someone's shitty apartment. It's like Krang from, it's like alien it seems like your Ninja Turtles. It was like a huge mason jar that was kept on top of our fridge with like, you know, dish towels over it to block the light. And Grace when I tell you like it made me scared to just get something out of the fridge. ""Like I felt like I was approaching but you know when you're like oh the basement is scary."" Like was me going up to the fridge being like I really hope. I don't get a glimpse of the mother. Yeah. Heard of the Mutter Museum, it's like an Oddities Museum. There's one in Philly, I'm not sure if it's like a chain. I mean, I've been to many a weird like, check out this bird with to head Museum. Yeah, it's like that.I've never been to it because it's not my, my pie boots. Yeah. But it's like you know preserved weird anomalies in jars and stuff. And that's how I think of The Mother. We oh God, oh God. Like I'm getting clumps is of the mother which if you guys have never seen this before, don't look at it. Because it'll It'll be hard to get back into kombucha because it literally, it looks like you're growing a blood clot. While I'm for the first time, having a thirst quenching sparkling kombucha. We started the this off with you, supporting me here No, but here's the deal. I respect it. This is, this is a multimillion-dollar company, they know what they're doing. Yeah. Do I want to drink bucho from my Brooklyn roommate? No fucking weird she's got growing any kitchen. Anyone to pour a bucket into a glass? And tell me to drink it. Yeah, like I definitely there was a moment there. I was like, I'm going to wake up and you're like, you're going to have died of botulism in the middle, the night. It's not a. Why can't we make pickles or something? The kombucha was a lot, but, I mean, I like a hard kombucha. Now, they just make an alcoholic to, oh, yeah, they've gone the other direction I will say, we've we're back in, we had the backyard and it feels so nice. I feel like we walked Get back into like Clarissa Explains It All his room, just like back in. Yeah, because chip was out of town. So, it was twofold. It was one. Hey, do you want to record inside because we can keep the temperature. Correct? Yeah, and also, I just, I let it get so poor crito quarterback here. And then he was going downtown. I was like, I better get my life back together for a second, so now it's nice it feels feel safe, it feels was he feels familiar Back on set. All the good things yeah, I'm into it. We're back on phone. Speaking of drinking things. I got a crazy story for you. Oh God. This was I got a voice text the other day from Val, our mutual good friend who did my makeup at the wedding longtime friend. Loved her, very closest very much. She sent me a voice text. And that's when you know, like, oh, this is what's going on here? I'm just now getting into Boys text. Oh, are you see? I haven't gotten into them because it feels like you're really making sure that someone's highly focused on. Well, I just thought I'd get it when you have something really important to say, I have a couple friends who they always send them and I like rejected it and we respond with text. Yeah and then I started doing voice text. For me it's more very foreign to not add punctuation. ""So it's going to say when you do voice to text like and then switch to voice text."" ""Are you still trying to put in 0? ' Is an exclamation point "" Julie. It's 1000% like hey Larry exclamation point, what are you?","This make it weird. Are we rolling? We're rolling.
