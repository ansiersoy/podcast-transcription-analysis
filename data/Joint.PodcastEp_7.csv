"Welcome back to the base. Welcome back to the basement yard. Don't give me that look. No, no, no, I'm, I'm trying to figure out your sweatshirt right now. Is it like? It's not to be figured out. It, it is to be figured, isn't a puzzle. It's it's not a puzzle, but it is a trick. Yours is more of a trick than mine. Mine is mine is lines, but it's like stripes. They're like they are interlocking. It's like a zip. No, but like is yours like supposed to be like 2 toned like that or is it just shining, shimmering splendid? No, it's it's like an ombre. I don't know if that's right. Fuck is that? What about my hair? Come on.You know, you know. I'm married to a woman. You think I don't understand what an ombre is? You don't. I'll be honest. I think it's just a blend, I think. It's just like hair, one color to another color. A gradient. Okay but you don't know what the gradient is? I but a gradient is a. A gradient like when it it like. It progressively like it's like exponential. So you have like a parabola of hair color. I don't know why you're choosing to make this harder than it is. I also definitely did no I. You remember parabolas. I do, but I did fail that. Really geometry. Quarter no, my math, so that was in high school, yeah. And my math averages I remember were like 8892 sixty 1085 and like the 61 was when parabolas. Parabolas I like parabolas. I was a big parabola guy. Love sine and cosine waves. And tangents. Tangents, you know, But I love parabolas, love exponents, the way they just kind of go up like a like a hill. It was pretty cool. I didn't fuck with that, but you know what I fucked with The TI-83 calculator. Dude, I was just to do this. Yo, I broke. I'm I'm gonna I fucking hacked school. OK, I figured it out. You figured school out. How'd you figure it out What you do. Well, because I went to baccalaureate for 7th and 10th grade and everything that we learned was like a year and a half ahead of what traditional public schools were learning. So like what you're referencing like all that's like advanced geometry and stuff like that, I had learned in like 7th going into 8th grade. Like we learned it quickly and. One second, one second. If you let me. If you let me, OK. Go ahead, go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. If you let me. Mr. Advanced Albert Einstein. First of all, and I was, I was a fucking whiz with that calculator. I also had games on mine so they'd be like, what are you doing? I'm like, I'm doing such hard work and it's like fucking snake and shit like that. That's what it was. It was snake. I had other games on there though too. I knew a kid that had fucking like a version of like Super Mario on there and shit like that. What. There was yo, you could plug some shit in Japanese. Was he Japanese? He wasn't not Japanese. That's what I'm saying. He could have been Korean, could have been Chinese, right? Could have been another part of, you know. They're just, they're just, what's the word? They're innovative. Bro, they're so like video games. I mean, Nintendo, it's Japanese, baby. That's what I'm saying. But what did Nintendo start off as? Do you know this? What do you mean? Before it was video games, you know. Do you remember what Nintendo was before? Oh yes, what? It was socks. No, I don't know. Trading cards? A lot of people don't know that. There you go. Now you're all advanced along with me. Nintendo made trading cards. Yeah, it did. But like in like. What were they? What was on the cards? Like Japanese stuff, I'm not quite sure. Oh, OK. I'm not quite sure. But so we learned it all. So when I left and went to a New York City public school, when I went to Bryant, I was ahead. So like I appeared way smarter to my classmates. Because you had already learned it. So it's like, oh, now you're doing it for. So I hacked I hacked the system. So then they were just like, whoa, wait a SEC, how are and I'm just like, I'm good. I had learned it two years, maybe a year and a half. Before.  So the hack is go to a school that's ahead, leave it, yeah, and then regress. Well, I didn't regress because I did one year and like the, you know, with like the normies. Well, he regressed academically. No, because then I went right into repeating math. I went to right into calculus, bitch. OK, so I didn't fucking regress. So they don't even do that. They also did the same thing in college to boost my GPA. I retook bro college. College. The first year of college, maybe even the first two years of college, is just the last two years of high school all over again. I wouldn't know. You're right, but like, so I remember, did I ever tell you that I got I got like recruited by my school to be a math major? Explain this. I yo. They they sat you down. Yes, I they got to go math scouts. I got a letter in the mail because. Were you good at math? Dude, I was a math whiz dude out of high school. I got offered like a free ride to Queen's College because they had like an incredible math teaching program. Didn't want to do it because I don't want to go sit in the car and look at this fence and be like, Oh my God, my life can be something. OK, joke's on me. Because you sat in a parking lot and smoked cigars and looked at Target. So, I mean, yeah, maybe you should have went with the fucking math. So, I mean, yeah, maybe you should have went with the fucking math. Could have worked on a rocket ship or something. Yeah, it's OK, it's fine. But I got everyone at my school at college, you have like a dedicated mailbox. And one time out of the random, I got an e-mail saying like, oh, you have mail in your mailbox. I was like, what the fuck? And it was from my school, from the head of the mouth math department. And he's like, yo, come call me, let's set up a meeting I want to talk to you about potential opportunity. This is kind of like how Harry got into Hogwarts. Like a letter just arrives. Well, that was way more magical than that. Was it stamped with like that ink? Mine was from like some random white guy. His was from Dumbledore dude. But did it have wax like a wax? No, it was just a regular bro if it had a wax stamp on it I'm not opening it.  I'm not I'm not I'm keeping it bro what am I? I think maybe it wasn't espo. Someone recently sent us something with a wax stamp on it. I was just like, damn, I don't want to touch this. It's probably Espo's wedding invitation. Might have been but but wax stamp, wax stamp. Cool dude. And like the the melting of the wax and then the stamp. Orgasmic. Mad. Let me tell you. Like watching that in movies where there's like. I also love watching the guys that dip the wine bottles in in wax and. Love that. And they're like. Yeah, yeah. And sometimes they they, they get a little deep, they get a little dirty. I want to shove my hand in boiling wax. I don't want to shove it in boiling wax. But like wax? I mean I definitely have like put my hand in wax but like not full hand dude. Someone once gave me a wax. Oh man, you're going to hate what dildo. No, no. Bro, I don't know. Why would you go? Remember I was in day camp. I was Spider Man. Yes, I remember when you were Spider Man. Yeah. So they went to like one of those places where you could like dip your hand in ice and then dip it immediately in a wax to make like a like a wax hand mold. And they did the Spider Man thing for me and I had it for a long time and then it must have melted.","Welcome back to the base. Welcome back to the basement yard. Don't give me that look.
