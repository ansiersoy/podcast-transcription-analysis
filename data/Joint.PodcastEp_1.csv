"Hello everyone and welcome back to Happy Human Club. I'm Soph Mosca. I'm the host of this podcast and today we are going to be talking all about New Year's resolutions. But obviously before we get in, I just want to say hi because obviously I've been gone since vlogmas started. I don't remember what the last podcast episode I did was. It might have honestly been the one or talk about books, I can't remember. But it was a long time ago and we are far overdue for a new episode. So before we jump into anything just want to plug my social media. You guys can follow me at South Mosca on pretty much every social media besides Snapchat is SOPHERRRI. Also have more exclusive content on passes. It's just pass.com/S Mosca I believe, but I think if you go to passes you could probably just search my name and find it there but it's also LinkedIn my hooby link which is in my BIOS. But I also just wanted to thank you guys for following along on vlogmas if you did. And I think you guys really enjoyed this year's vlogmas. I will say this wasn't my favorite Vlogmas ever. I definitely had like a lot going on behind the scenes. One of which like the elephant in the room I moved and I was dealing with you know, figuring out how to work out the like termination of a lease, which I've never had to do before. And it was just like overwhelming on top of you know, literally living with the place with all the issues that you know were the reason I left. And then also like finding a new place in the finances of that. Because moving no matter how you do it is so expensive and just you know all that on top of the holidays and I had all these pre planned holiday travels that were happening during you know all that. Like I don't know it was just not my favorite vlogmas ever. But I also think it was hard because I was like comparing it to last year and last year was just like an exceptionally fun vlogmas. I was just in a stage of life where every single day I was just hanging out with friends doing all these fun things and just made for like really fun vlogs. And I'm just in a different stage of life. Or at least like, you know, in that moment in December, like, I just was in a different stage of life where I had a lot going on versus like last December. I was at more of like a null and more of like a standstill and just was able to like enjoy life, enjoy my time. But I'm happy that you guys enjoyed the vlogs regardless. And yeah, that was log miss. Also, thank you for your patience during Vlogmas because there weren't any podcast episodes. So overall just thank you guys. And so like I said, I moved. I now live in a house. It's still rented but I did move to a house. If you guys haven't been following along on I guess I really only talked about it on my blogs, but my apartment just it had like every health worry issue that there could be. They're not even help. Like there was mold, there was roaches, but then also like my hot water would go out for like hours to days on end constantly. There's so much more. My garage door would be like jammed open. Like the garage for the whole building would be like jammed open so it wouldn't be closing. Which like obviously, like I lived in a really busy area where like car theft would have been like very, very possible. And like you know when you're when you move into a place and you're paying for things you think you're getting and you don't end up getting them, that's when it becomes an issue. So like the the door was never closing or not never. But the door often got jammed in the garage and like there was like front door security issues. Like sometimes my key literally wouldn't open the front door and then sometimes I wouldn't need a key to open the front door. Which obviously is a a security issue in and of itself. The elevators, a whole other story literally just so much. And then there was like just the dryer didn't work and on top of these issues, the management like wasn't solving them. So obviously before I got to the point of like I'm I need to terminate this lease, I had reached out again and again and again trying to resolve the issues 'cause I didn't want to have to move, you know, like I moving, like I said, it cost so much. I just moved like 6 months ago and it was a big move. It was from Florida to LA. Like I didn't want to move again. So obviously like I had tried and tried and tried to get these things fixed and there would be times when like towards the end of it I would have sent like 5 emails because five different things came up and no answer. But then I don't think I told this online but like so like this was my breaking point I had sent. It was like everything was going wrong. I didn't have hot water. I found a couple more roaches. I like the mold was an issue that kept coming to like quote-unquote fix my washer. But all they would do is like clean it with vinegar and like it wasn't actually solving the mold issue. Like the mold isn't only like what you can see. You know, like mold spreads and it's like probably in the wall and it's like it's just like nothing was actually being solved. And I had like 6 technicians come and basically just like, tell me my dryer is broken. And I'm like, I know, I know, But no one was fixing it. No one was replacing it. Like, it was just like absurd. And I've been sending emails about like all the things that were going wrong. It's not getting a reply. And then I had my automatic rent payments turned on, but I forgot that I had turned them off. I think I forget why I did it. I think I was like switching a card or something. I don't remember. But I had automatic payments accidentally turned off. And so the day after rent was due, like, obviously I thought that it was automatically paid. But the day after it was due, I got an e-mail saying like, not an automatic e-mail, like literally an e-mail from the guy had I had been trying to get in contact with telling me that my rent was late and that I needed to pay it like immediately. And that was my breaking point because I was like, well, now I know, like you are blatantly ignoring my emails about real concerns, like health concerns, safety concerns, but you'll still take my money. And like, that was just my breaking point. But anyways, I ended up moving and I now live in a house. Wait. Also guys, side note, because I just took a sip of it. I'm drinking this Chamberlain coffee, canned coffee I've heard so many people hate on it. It's literally so good.","Hello everyone and welcome back to Happy Human Club. I'm Soph Mosca.
